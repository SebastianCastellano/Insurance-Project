# Insurance-Project
Repository for the project of the course of Insurance - Polimi 2021/2022

Group members: Sebastian Castellano, Giulia Mulattieri, Virginia Muscionico

In the project we consider a simplified insurance company whose assets and liabilities sides are provided, and answer to the following requests.
1. Compute the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement via Standard Formula and provide comments on the results obtained. The risks considered are:
• Market Interest
• Market equity
• Life mortality
• Life lapse
• Life cat
• Expense
2. Calculate the Macaulay BEL duration in all the cases and provide comments
on the results obtained.
3. Split the BEL value into its main PV components: premiums (=0), death
benefits, lapse benefits, expenses, and commissions.
4. Replicate the same calculations in an Excel spread sheet using a deterministic
projection. Do the results differ from 1? If so, what is the reason behind?
5. Open questions:
• what happens to the asset and liabilities when the risk-free rate increases/decreases with a parallel shift of, say, 100bps? Describe the effects for all the BEL components.
• what happens to the liabilities if the insured age increases? What if there were two model points, one male and one female
